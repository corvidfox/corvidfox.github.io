## Purpose

This site is a personal portfolio designed to translate existing work into polished, recruiter-ready case studies.

The goal is to highlight:

Whether you're a hiring manager, team lead, or fellow analyst, this site offers a curated window into how I solve problems with clarity, curiosity, and code.

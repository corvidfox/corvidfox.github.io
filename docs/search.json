    "text": "Hi — I’m Morri, a data scientist with a clinical background, an MPH in progress, and a serious love of health data. I work at the intersection of epidemiology, bioinformatics, and analytics, building tools that make large, messy datasets more useful for research and public health. I’m especially excited by omics, reproducibility, and clever ways to reduce human effort without sacrificing rigor.\nBefore pivoting to data science, I spent over a decade as a nurse and educator — so I know my way around both a CRRT machine and a good data pipeline. My projects range from fuzzy-matching patient records across data sets, to meta-analyzing EWAS studies, to modeling viral phylogenies for vaccine strain selection.\nI care deeply about clarity, collaboration, and doing science that’s useful. I’d love to work on research teams, data-heavy health projects, or anything that needs solid analysis and a thoughtful partner. (Also: the dog’s name is Lucy.

# Project Summary

**DETECT-RPC** is a multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a revised version of the DETECT elder mistreatment screening tool, adapted for use in primary care settings. The study spans seven home-based primary care programs across the U.S., with data collection ongoing. It includes both the RCT and qualitative follow-up interviews with patients, caregivers, and clinicians.

- **Tool**: DETECT-RPC screening instrument  
- **Institution**: [UTHealth School of Public Health (Dallas Campus)](https://sph.uth.edu/campuses/dallas)  
- **PI**: [Dr. M. Brad Cannell](https://brad-cannell.github.io/)  
- **Partners**: Baylor College of Medicine, Johns Hopkins, UCSF, UAB, UTSW, UTHealth Houston (LBJ & UTP)  
- **Study Registration**: [ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05958654](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05958654?term=detect&rank=2)  
- **Project Involvement**: Feb 2022 – Aug 2025  
- **Status**: Active; data collection ongoing

# Tech Stack & Infrastructure

This project required cross-platform coordination, secure data handling, and scalable tooling across clinical and research environments.

## Platforms & Systems

- `REDCap` — survey instrument design and deployment  
- `CANVAS` — clinician training modules  
- `GitHub` — collaborative code development  
- `OneDrive` — secure PHI-compliant data storage  
- `CERNER` & `EPIC` — EMR systems for ETL planning  
- `Quarto`, `Microsoft Word`, `Visio`, `Canva` — reporting, documentation, and visual design

# My Contributions

## Protocol & IRB Development
- Co-authored IRB protocols and informed consent documents  
- Drafted internal SOPs and statistical analysis plans  
- Drafted selection screening instruments and study methods

## Data Infrastructure & ETL Planning  
- Assisted with design of ETL pipeline for EMR data from CERNER and EPIC systems  
- Coordinated data governance and PHI compliance across sites

## Recruitment & Tracking Systems
- Assisted with build of in-house dashboards for recruitment and subject tracking  
- Designed REDCap survey instruments for caregivers, patients, and clinicians  
- Assisted with creation of recruitment materials and clinician training content (CANVAS)

## Team Coordination & Mentorship  
- Interfaced with Co-Investigators across seven institutions  
- Supported junior team members in dashboard development, IRB and compliance documentation, and survey design  

# Reflections

This project represents a full-spectrum research experience—from protocol design to infrastructure planning and stakeholder coordination. I helped architect the data pipeline, design recruitment and survey tools, and build reproducible workflows across multiple institutions. DETECT-RPC is a model for how public health research can scale across clinical systems while maintaining rigor, privacy, and clarity.

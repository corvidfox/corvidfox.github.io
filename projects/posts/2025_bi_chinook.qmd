_A recruiter-ready showcase of SQL-powered storytelling and dashboard engineering_

This project demonstrates applied analytics workflows anchored in real business questions using a structured but compact dataset. Inspired by business intelligence toolchains, it combines SQL-driven data modeling with interactive dashboards across R (Shiny), Python, and Tableau. Each deliverable highlights how I approach KPIs, retention metrics, and executive-level insights—core skills that translate across industries and team functions.

# Why This Matters

In fast-paced, data-driven organizations, analysts and decision-makers rely on clear, actionable insights from messy or evolving data. This project was built to spotlight:

- End-to-end analytics: data exploration → SQL ETL → dashboard design
- SQL proficiency across joins, windows, staging, and KPI calculation
- Dashboard interfaces tailored for technical and non-technical users
- Cross-platform fluency in R, Python and, Tableau
- Modular architecture designed for scalability and reuse

Designed with interview walkthroughs in mind, this portfolio piece simulates the analytical cycles common in business contexts—where performance, clarity, and speed matter. It reflects how thoughtful engineering and data storytelling can bridge gaps between raw data and real decisions.

# Business Questions

Throughout this project, I explored key questions relevant to business strategy, customer behavior, and performance insights, with a time-based perspective embedded in each analysis:

1. **Where is revenue coming from geographically?**  
2. **What genres or artists generate the most income?**  
3. **How many customers are repeat buyers?**

These questions shaped both the exploratory analysis and the design of each dashboard panel.

# Deliverables {#deliverables}

To showcase the analytics pipeline across multiple formats, I produced the following deliverables. Each highlights a different stage—from insight development to stakeholder-ready dashboards:

| Deliverable         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Static Report       | Exploratory deep dive using R & Python with SQL-backed plots |
| R + Shiny Dashboard | Interactive dashboard with modular components and KPI filters |
| Python + Dash Dashboard     | Dashboard with Plotly and DuckDB SQL  |
| Tableau Workbook    | Clean visualization interface for non-coders |

## Exploratory Report {#d1-report}

This report performs a structured deep dive into the dataset to identify key patterns, trends, and opportunities. It frames strategic business questions in a readable format and sets the stage for later dashboard design.

It’s built in Quarto and hosted on this site. Visualizations include time-series charts, choropleth maps, cohort retention heatmaps, all paired with summary insights and strategy callouts.

## Tableau Dashboard {#d4-tableaubi}

As a final translation, this Tableau dashboard replicates the same KPIs, insights, and filtering experience as the R and Python versions, this time optimized for point-and-click consumption by business users. It’s designed to demonstrate fluency across platforms and provide an accessible, "no-code" interface for stakeholders.

The dashboard features collapsible filters for **genre**, **artist**, **country**, and **time range**, with dynamic KPI cards, time-series visualizations, and ranked charts across geography, genre, and artist. Retention metrics are presented using cohort analysis and decay curves, while the “Key Insights” panel includes executive summaries and side-by-side KPI comparisons. All visualizations are interactive, with tooltips, scrollable tables, and hover-based highlights.

### Key Features

- Filterable interface for business and non-technical users  
- Metric selection and dynamic drill-downs by country, genre, artist, and time  
- Stacked bar and area plots for per-genre and per-artist trends  
- Retention visualizations via decay curve and cohort heatmap  
- Executive “Insights” panel with summary stats and strategic flags  
- Fully hosted and accessible via Tableau Public

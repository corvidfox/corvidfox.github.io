_A recruiter-ready showcase of SQL-powered storytelling and dashboard engineering_

This project demonstrates applied analytics workflows anchored in real business questions using a structured but compact dataset. Inspired by business intelligence toolchains, it combines SQL-driven data modeling with an interactive dashboard built in R (Shiny). <!--# with interactive dashboards across R (Shiny), Python, and Tableau. --> Each deliverable highlights how I approach KPIs, retention metrics, and executive-level insights‚Äîcore skills that translate across industries and team functions.

# Why This Matters

In fast-paced, data-driven organizations, analysts and decision-makers rely on clear, actionable insights from messy or evolving data. This project was built to spotlight:

- End-to-end analytics: data exploration ‚Üí SQL ETL ‚Üí dashboard design
- SQL proficiency across joins, windows, staging, and KPI calculation
- Dashboard interfaces tailored for technical and non-technical users
<!--# - Cross-platform fluency in R, Python, Tableau  -->
- Modular architecture designed for scalability and reuse

Designed with interview walkthroughs in mind, this portfolio piece simulates the analytical cycles common in business contexts‚Äîwhere performance, clarity, and speed matter. It reflects how thoughtful engineering and data storytelling can bridge gaps between raw data and real decisions.

# Business Questions

Throughout this project, I explored key questions relevant to business strategy, customer behavior, and performance insights, with a time-based perspective embedded in each analysis:

1. **Where is revenue coming from geographically?**  
2. **What genres or artists generate the most income?**  
3. **How many customers are repeat buyers?**

These questions shaped both the exploratory analysis and the design of each dashboard panel.

# Deliverables {#deliverables}

To showcase the analytics pipeline across multiple formats, I produced the following deliverables. Each highlights a different stage‚Äîfrom insight development to stakeholder-ready dashboards:

| Deliverable         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Static Report       | Exploratory deep dive using R & Python with SQL-backed plots |
| R + Shiny Dashboard | Interactive dashboard with modular components and KPI filters |
<!--#  | Python + Dash      | Dashboard with Plotly and DuckDB SQL (in development) | -->
<!--# | Tableau Workbook    | Clean visualization interface for non-coders (in development) | -->

## Exploratory Report {#d1-report}

This report performs a structured deep dive into the dataset to identify key patterns, trends, and opportunities. It frames strategic business questions in a readable format and sets the stage for later dashboard design.

It‚Äôs built in Quarto and hosted on this site. Visualizations include time-series charts, choropleth maps, cohort retention heatmaps, all paired with summary insights and strategy callouts.

## R + Shiny Dashboard {#d2-rshinybi}

Designed as an interactive walkthrough, this dashboard showcases how SQL-powered insights can drive filtering, visuals, and decision-support. The dashboard includes genre, artist, country, and time filters with dedicated panels for temporal trends, geographic distribution, performance by genre and artist, customer retention, and narrative key insights. Key KPIs are identified and displayed on all panels.

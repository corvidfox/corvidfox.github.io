# Project Summary
This project was a continuation of [DETECT](./2023_detect_1-year.html), a screening questionnaire embedded in MedStar’s EMS electronic patient care record (ePCR) software designed to help medics identify potential elder mistreatment (EM). The analysis covered EMS records from **July 1, 2019 to May 31, 2023**, matched to Texas **Adult Protective Services (APS)** data (originally spread across 5 relational CSV files). The focus was to evaluate screening fidelity, reporting intent, and APS follow-through over a longer time horizon.

- **Tool**: DETECT EM screening questionnaire  
- **Institution**: [University of Texas Health Sciences Center, School of Public Health (Dallas Campus)](https://sph.uth.edu/campuses/dallas)  
- **PI**: [Dr. M. Brad Cannell](https://brad-cannell.github.io/)  
- **Partners**: [MedStar Mobile Healthcare](https://www.medstar911.org/) & [Texas APS](https://www.dfps.state.tx.us/adult_protection/)  
- **Data Timeframe**: July 2019 - May 2023  
- **Project Involvement**: May 2024 - August 2025  
- **Status**: Analysis completed; manuscript in revision

# Tech Stack & Project Constraints

All work was completed on a **single local workstation** with no access to server-grade infrastructure or high-performance computing. This required careful memory optimization, modular workflow design, and rigorous reproducibility — particularly while managing over 500K APS records and 92K EMS records.

## Core Tools & Libraries (R)

- `tidyverse`, `here`, `janitor` — wrangling, reproducible structure  
- `fastLink` — high-volume probabilistic record linkage  
- `codebookr`, `data.table`, `readxl` — documentation and input handling  
- `irr` — interrater reliability & agreement metrics  
- `ggplot2`, `patchwork`, `consort` — statistical visualizations and diagrams

## Collaboration & Cloud Tools

- `GitHub` — team-based code development and versioning  
- `OneDrive` — secure PHI-compliant cloud data storage  
- `Quarto` — reproducible and annotated reports  
- `Microsoft Word`, `Canva`, `Visio` — manuscript drafting and presentation

# My Contributions

## APS Data Cleaning & Standardization
- Cleaned and validated APS subject identifiers
- Applied USPS-linked ZIP validation and state-county mappings  
- Parsed and restructured race/ethnicity and address strings

## Subject Identification & Deduplication
- Performed within-set `fastLink` matching on APS data to form unique APS subject IDs  
- Chunked matching by identifier completeness to manage memory constraints  
- Reduced 378K APS identifiers to 370K deduplicated IDs (~2% reduction)

## EMS–APS Linkage
- Benchmarked cross-set matching variables and created optimized maps between EMS and APS subjects  
- Built temporal linkage models connecting EMS responses to APS intakes and investigations  
- Consolidated investigation-level allegations and standardized APS outcome flags 

## Subject-Level Data Construction
- Consolidated demographic fields using reviewed heuristics (most common value, then first-in)  
- Derived subject-level outcomes (e.g. any reported mistreatment)

## Analytical Work
- Explored response patterns, demographic stratifications, and temporal trends  
- Assessed agreement between screening results, medic intent, APS intake, and APS outcome  
- Constructed multi-layer consort flow diagrams

## Documentation & Mentorship
- Authored full codebooks for derived data sets  
- Co-authored academic manuscript (currently in revision)  
- Mentored junior colleague in data wrangling, documentation, and writing process

# Code Highlights

The MedStar data was cleaned and provided within-set subject IDs by a junior colleague, using the process I'd previously developed in the [DETECT 1-Year Pilot Evaluation](./2023_detect_1-year.html) project.

# Reflections

This project pushed the limits of public health data infrastructure—requiring thoughtful deduplication, linkage theory, and scalable analysis under compute constraints. I developed chunked fuzzy matching workflows and robust mapping strategies to integrate fragmented APS records with EMS screening data. As a secondary author on the manuscript, I also mentored a junior colleague through the analysis and writing process—making this not just a technical milestone, but a leadership one.
